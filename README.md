# Parker Robison's Professional Portfolio

## Purpose
A website that displays information about me including: 
my name, a photo of me, a brief bio, the projects that I have created, and links to social media and github.
This is done so that a future employer would be able to see my work and know how to contact me. There are five sections to the page: the header+nav bar, the hero, a bio, work, and contact and social media in the footer. 

  It is intended that the nav bar links direct you to the appropriate part of the page. The resume link doesn't direct you to anything because it wasn't within the perameters of this assignment. The tile grid layout of the "work" section can be interacted with. The tiles will send you to the corresponding project website, or to my GitHub page if there is a coming soon title. Additionally, a filter will be removed from a tile when you hover over it. Lastly, the links in the footer should direct you to the appropriate form of contact.
